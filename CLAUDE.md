## üåü Best Practices Guide

### ‚úÖ Pre-Task Confirmation
Before starting any task, Claude Code will respond:
"‚úÖ Best practices guide loaded - I will follow all recommendations and workflows in CLAUDE.md"

### üöÄ File Organization Best Practices
- Organize all files in appropriate module structures
- Output files should be placed in dedicated output/ or dist/ directories
- Documentation files are welcome when explicitly requested by the user
- Configuration values should use config files or environment variables
- Maintain single source of truth

### üîß MCP Tool Usage Principles
- Prioritize appropriate MCP tools
- Context7 over web search
- Brave Search for real-time information
- Graphiti Memory for personalization
- Playwright for web testing
- Sequential Thinking for complex problems
- Combine tools for enhanced performance

### üí° Tool Usage Recommendations
- Prioritize Claude Code built-in tools (Read, LS, Grep, Glob)
- For programming language and framework documentation, prioritize Context7 MCP tool
- For searching latest information, prioritize Brave Search MCP tool
- For remembering user preferences and workflows, prioritize Graphiti Memory MCP tool
- For browser automation testing, prioritize Playwright MCP tool
- For complex problem analysis, prioritize Sequential Thinking MCP tool
- Task tool is best for long-running operations (>30 seconds)
- TodoWrite is great for managing complex tasks (3+ steps)

### üéØ Code Quality Recommendations
- Prioritize extending existing functionality over creating duplicate implementations
- Use descriptive naming, avoid version suffixes
- When code is duplicated, consider extracting to shared functions or modules
- Search for existing implementations before creating new functionality

### üîê Version Control Recommendations
- Commit manually when code is ready
- Push to remote after confirmation
- Use clear commit messages
- Commit after each feature completion

### ‚ö° Execution Mode Recommendations
- Parallel task agents can greatly improve efficiency
- Systematic workflows provide best results
- Task agents are best for background processing

### üß† Extended Thinking Mode
When to use extended thinking:
- Planning complex architecture changes
- Debugging complex problems
- Creating implementation plans for new features
- Understanding complex codebases
- Evaluating trade-offs between different approaches

Usage:
- Basic thinking: Use "think"
- Deep thinking: Use "think harder", "think more", "think deeply"
- Sequential Thinking integration: For multi-step reasoning problems

### üß† Graphiti Memory Usage Guide

> **üí° When to Use Graphiti Memory**
> - Remember user preferences and workflows
> - Build and maintain knowledge graphs
> - Track project requirements and fact relationships
> - Enable personalized assistant features

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**
> When the following situations arise, prioritize using the Graphiti Memory tool:
> - User mentions personal preferences or habits
> - Need to remember project-specific workflows
> - Building long-term knowledge management systems
> - Enabling personalized development experience

#### üìã Before Starting Any Task
- **Always search first**: Use `search_nodes` tool to find relevant preferences and procedures
- **Search for facts**: Use `search_facts` tool to discover relationships and factual information
- **Filter by entity type**: Specify `Preference`, `Procedure`, or `Requirement` in node searches
- **Review all matches**: Carefully examine preferences, procedures, or facts relevant to current task

#### üìù Saving New or Updated Information
- **Capture requirements and preferences immediately**: When user expresses requirements or preferences, immediately use `add_memory` to store
  - _Best practice:_ Split very long requirements into shorter, logical chunks
- **Be explicit about updates**: If updating existing knowledge, only add what's changed or new
- **Document procedures clearly**: When discovering user workflows, record them as procedures
- **Record factual relationships**: When learning about entity connections, store these as facts
- **Use specific categories**: Label preferences and procedures with clear categories for better retrieval

#### üîê Project Isolation and Storage Standards
- **Use group_id for project isolation**: Each project uses its root directory name as group_id
  - _Standard format_: `project_[directory_name]` (e.g., `project_superclaude`)
  - _Benefits_: Intuitive, easy to identify, avoids memory confusion
  
- **Explicitly specify group_id when storing**:
  ```python
  # Example: Store preferences for specific project
  # Assuming current directory is /home/user/superclaude
  mcp__graphiti-memory__add_memory(
      name="Code style preferences",
      episode_body="Use 4 spaces for indentation, max line length 80 chars",
      group_id="project_superclaude",  # Use project directory name
      source="text"
  )
  ```

- **Filter by group_id when searching**:
  ```python
  # Example: Search only current project's memories
  mcp__graphiti-memory__search_memory_nodes(
      query="code style",
      group_ids=["project_superclaude"],  # Limit search scope
      entity="Preference"
  )
  ```

- **Knowledge management strategy**:
  - Project-specific memories: Use `project_[directory_name]` format
  - Global shared preferences: Use `global_preferences` as group_id
  - Auto-detection: Claude Code should automatically set appropriate group_id based on current working directory

#### üéØ During Your Work
- **Respect discovered preferences**: Align work with found preferences
- **Follow procedures exactly**: If finding a procedure for current task, follow it step by step
- **Apply relevant facts**: Use factual information to inform decisions and recommendations
- **Stay consistent**: Maintain consistency with previously identified preferences, procedures, and facts

#### üí° Best Practices
- **Search before suggesting**: Always check for established knowledge before making recommendations
- **Combine node and fact searches**: For complex tasks, search both nodes and facts for complete picture
- **Use `center_node_uuid`**: When exploring related information, center search around specific node
- **Prioritize specific matches**: More specific information takes precedence over general information
- **Be proactive**: If noticing user behavior patterns, consider storing them as preferences or procedures

**Remember**: The knowledge graph is your memory. Use it consistently to provide personalized assistance that respects the user's established preferences, procedures, and factual context.

## üö® Technical Debt Prevention Best Practices

### Workflow
1. Search first - Use Grep/Glob to find existing implementations
2. Analyze existing - Read and understand current patterns
3. Decision evaluation: Can extend existing? ‚Üí Execute | Must create new? ‚Üí Document reason
4. Follow patterns - Use established project patterns
5. Validate - Ensure no duplication or technical debt

# Important Instruction Reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
Never create files unless absolutely necessary.
Always prefer editing existing files to creating new ones.
Never proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
